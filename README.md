# projects
A set of projects by me
Includes a simulation of file filou and a code used to calculate a certain sequence.
Note that the sequence is nowhere on the internet but things I made, and is not on oeis.
I also created a primative DAW with ADT invented by Ken Townsend and Rev_ADT invented by me. It also includes multiple synth settings and soon a system to edit music.

Most projects use python or js, python being really easy to use and js being the superior coding language.
