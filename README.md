# projects
A set of projects by me
Includes a simulation of file filou and a code used to calculate a certain sequence.
Note that the sequence is nowhere on the internet but things I made, and is not on oeis.
I also created a primative DAW with ADT invented by Ken Townsend and Rev_ADT invented by me. It also includes multiple synth settings and soon a system to edit music. The DAW was made in colaboration with someone who is good at music and knows what he's doing with code too.

Most projects use python or js, python being really easy to use and js being the superior coding language.

I would love to hear about improvements to my terrible code.
